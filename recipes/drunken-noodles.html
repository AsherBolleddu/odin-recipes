    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Soak rice noodles in hot water until flexible, 10 to 15 minutes.
        Occasionally move the noodles around to separate them. Drain the water
        and cover with a wet paper towel.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine oyster sauce, soy sauce, Asian fish sauce, maple syrup, sugar,
        and water in a small bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat vegetable oil and sesame oil in a wok, or large frying pan, over
        medium-high heat. Stir-fry shallots, chile peppers, and garlic until
        shallots are soft, about 2 minutes. Move the mixture around the outside
        of the pan to create a space and add chicken. Sear for 1 minute, then
        combine with shallot mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add Chinese broccoli stems and stir-fry until tender, about 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Add Chinese broccoli leaves and stir-fry until wilted.</li>
      <li>
        Add drunken noodle sauce and sliced scallions; mix well and cook until
        sauce begins to simmer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add soaked rice noodles and toss to coat until noodles have absorbed the
        sauce and are cooked through, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in Thai basil leaves until wilted. Taste and adjust seasoning if
        needed. Serve.
