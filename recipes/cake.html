      This heaven on earth cake is an easy summer no-bake dessert that can be

    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (14 ounce) purchased angel food cake, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
      <li>1 (21 ounce) can cherry pie filling, divided</li>
      <li>
        1 (3.4 ounce) package vanilla instant pudding mix and pie filling (such
        as Jell-OÂ®)
      </li>
      <li>1&frac12; cups whole milk or half-and-half</li>
      <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed</li>
      <li>sliced almonds (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Place half of angel food cake pieces in the bottom of a deep 8-x-8-inch
        or 9x9-inch baking dish in an even layer. Spread 1 cup cherry pie
        filling over top of cake. Top with remaining cake pieces in an even
        layer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk together vanilla pudding mix, whole milk, and sour cream in a
        large bowl until slightly thickened and smooth, about 1 minute.
      </li>
      <li>Pour pudding mix over top of cake and spread evenly.</li>
      <li>
        Spread thawed whipped topping over pudding layer. Dot with remaining 1
        cup cherry pie filling. Using a toothpick or spoon, swoop and swirl pie
        filling into the whipped topping. Refrigerate, uncovered, for at least 8
        hours or up to 12 hours. Garnish with sliced almonds.
